# Tic-Tac-Toe-Script

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Join to the correct path of the clone
3. Use `python tictactoe.py` to execute script

## Description

I made a tic tac toe in python using the console to play. Basically the user will be able to choose between three game modes: user vs user, user vs ia and ia vs ia. Each player will have a turn to choose, every time a player plays a game it will be checked if the user who played won, in case of not winning the game will continue. In case of winning a winner will be dictated.

## Technologies used

## Documentation

In the `grid_board` variable we are going to build our game board, in `game_finish` it will be a variable to detect if the game finished or not and finally the `count` that we are going to record when each player could play, if 9 were played Sometimes it means that the game ended in a draw:

```
grid_board = [["A1", "A2", "A3"], ["B1", "B2", "B3"], ["C1", "C2", "C3"]]
game_finish = False
count = 0
```

In the `generate_board_game()` function we are going to generate the game board:

```
def generate_board_game(grid_board):

    for grid in grid_board:
        print(grid)

    return
```

In the `change_grid()` function, every time the players play, the game board will be updated:

```
def change_grid(grid_board, user_value_grid, symbol, possible_choices):

    global count

    for line in grid_board:
        for index, element in enumerate(line):
            if user_value_grid == element:
                line[index] = symbol
                count += 1
                possible_choices.pop(possible_choices.index(user_value_grid))
                return generate_board_game(grid_board), line[index]

    user_value_grid = input("Oops, select other: ")
    return change_grid(grid_board, user_value_grid, symbol, possible_choices)
```

In the `check_game_finish()` function we will check who won or if there is a tie:

```
def check_game_finish(symbolA, symbolB):

    global game_finish

    if symbolA == grid_board[0][0] and symbolA == grid_board[0][1] and symbolA == grid_board[0][2] or \
        symbolA == grid_board[1][0] and symbolA == grid_board[1][1] and symbolA == grid_board[1][2] or \
        symbolA == grid_board[2][0] and symbolA == grid_board[2][1] and symbolA == grid_board[2][2] or \
        symbolA == grid_board[0][0] and symbolA == grid_board[1][0] and symbolA == grid_board[2][0] or \
        symbolA == grid_board[0][1] and symbolA == grid_board[1][1] and symbolA == grid_board[2][1] or \
        symbolA == grid_board[0][2] and symbolA == grid_board[1][2] and symbolA == grid_board[2][2] or \
        symbolA == grid_board[0][0] and symbolA == grid_board[1][1] and symbolA == grid_board[2][2] or \
        symbolA == grid_board[0][2] and symbolA == grid_board[1][1] and symbolA == grid_board[2][0]:
        game_finish = True
        return print("PLAYER A WINS!")

    elif symbolB == grid_board[0][0] and symbolB == grid_board[0][1] and symbolB == grid_board[0][2] or \
        symbolB == grid_board[1][0] and symbolB == grid_board[1][1] and symbolB == grid_board[1][2] or \
        symbolB == grid_board[2][0] and symbolB == grid_board[2][1] and symbolB == grid_board[2][2] or \
        symbolB == grid_board[0][0] and symbolB == grid_board[1][0] and symbolB == grid_board[2][0] or \
        symbolB == grid_board[0][1] and symbolB == grid_board[1][1] and symbolB == grid_board[2][1] or \
        symbolB == grid_board[0][2] and symbolB == grid_board[1][2] and symbolB == grid_board[2][2] or \
        symbolB == grid_board[0][0] and symbolB == grid_board[1][1] and symbolB == grid_board[2][2] or \
        symbolB == grid_board[0][2] and symbolB == grid_board[1][1] and symbolB == grid_board[2][0]:
        game_finish = True
        return print("PLAYER B WINS!")

    elif count == 9:
        game_finish = True
        return print("TIED GAME!")
```

Here we have the 3 game modes available, the user will be asked which game mode he wants to play based on an index between 1 to 3, depending on the index he chooses, a game mode will be selected. The available game modes are `user_vs_user, user_vs_ia and ia_vs_ia`:

```
def user_vs_user():

    possible_choices = ["A1", "A2", "A3", "B1", "B2", "B3", "C1", "C2", "C3"]

    userA_symbol = input("[USER A] Select your symbol like [X or O] but you can select other: ")
    userB_symbol = input("[USER B] Select your symbol like [X or O] but you can select other: ")

    while userB_symbol == userA_symbol:
        userB_symbol = input("[USER B] Select your symbol like [X or O] but you can select other: ")

    while game_finish == False:
        userA = input("User A plays: ").upper()
        change_grid(grid_board, userA, userA_symbol, possible_choices)
        check_game_finish(userA_symbol, userB_symbol)

        if game_finish:
            break

        userB = input("User B plays: ").upper()
        change_grid(grid_board, userB, userB_symbol, possible_choices)
        check_game_finish(userA_symbol, userB_symbol)

def user_vs_IA():

    possible_choices = ["A1", "A2", "A3", "B1", "B2", "B3", "C1", "C2", "C3"]

    IA_symbol = "X"
    user_symbol = input("[USER] Select your symbol like [X or O] but you can select other: ")

    while user_symbol == IA_symbol:
        user_symbol = input("[USER] Select your symbol like [X or O] but you can select other: ")

    while game_finish == False:
        user = input("User plays: ").upper()
        change_grid(grid_board, user, user_symbol, possible_choices)
        check_game_finish(user_symbol, IA_symbol)
        sleep(1)
        if game_finish:
            break

        IA_plays = choice(possible_choices)
        print(f"IA plays: {IA_plays}")
        change_grid(grid_board, IA_plays, IA_symbol, possible_choices)
        check_game_finish(user_symbol, IA_symbol)

def IA_vs_IA():

    possible_choices = ["A1", "A2", "A3", "B1", "B2", "B3", "C1", "C2", "C3"]

    IA_one_symbol = "X"
    IA_two_symbol = "O"

    while game_finish == False:
        IA_one_plays = choice(possible_choices)
        print(f"IA One plays: {IA_one_plays}")
        change_grid(grid_board, IA_one_plays, IA_one_symbol, possible_choices)
        check_game_finish(IA_one_symbol,IA_two_symbol)
        sleep(1)

        if game_finish:
            break

        IA_two_plays = choice(possible_choices)
        print(f"IA Two plays: {IA_two_plays}")
        change_grid(grid_board, IA_two_plays, IA_two_symbol, possible_choices)
        check_game_finish(IA_one_symbol,IA_two_symbol)
        sleep(1)
```

At this time depending on what the player chooses, a game mode with its own logic will be selected:

```
try:
    mode_selected = int(input("Select a number of MODE: "))

    while mode_selected < 1 or mode_selected > 3:
        mode_selected = int(input("Select a number of MODE: "))

    if mode_selected == 1:
        user_vs_user()
    elif mode_selected == 2:
        user_vs_IA()
    elif mode_selected == 3:
        IA_vs_IA()
except ValueError:
    print("ThatÂ´s not an int!")
```
